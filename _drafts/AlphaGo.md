## AlphaGo means the future is coming faster than anyone predicted.

What’s newsworthy isn’t just that AlphaGo has won Lee Sedol, who is probably the most well known active player today, but what this means for the acceleration of the pace at which computers are getting smarter.

The next ten years, instead of building towards a computer that can play Go, lots of significant innovation will be built on top of a computer that has mastered Go using a novel combination of A.I. approaches. I am very sure that, with the influence of the match and the technology Google has shared with, many researchers will create more useful products for humans and a lot of industry innovation is going to happen.

In the short term, the implication is that AI researchers now have a proven technique to build extremely competitive game playing machines. However, the broader implication is much larger. The future is coming faster than anyone predicted and it is an exciting future to look forward to.
