However, it’s the timeless thingsthat have proven their quality against the test of time over and over againthat truly interest me. Take for example the plethora of books that are wellover a century old which still get referenced today. Sun Tzu’s The Art of War,for example, was written in 513 BCE. Heck, even Andy Grove’s High OutputManagement from the 80’s is still pretty relevant even in today’s modern era. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VIM is one of these ageless things. VIM is a famous tool for editing code, butonly a few know the power it holds for text editing. The greatest thing aboutVIM is that you must control every move with your keyboard shortcuts (nomouse!), which forces your brain to train your muscle memory to become a magicwand over your text. You only have to think it, and your content has alreadychanged. VIM is coincidentally also one of the most hated programs of all timedue to its steep learning curve. But for those who love VIM, we love itvehemently for the power and speed that it brings to our coding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;haters&quot;&gt;Haters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I&amp;#39;vebeen using Vim for about 2 years now, mostly because I can&amp;#39;t figure out howto exit it.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; I Am Devloper (@iamdevloper) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/435555976687923200&quot;&gt;February 17,2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;lovers-include-tim-oreilly-and-ycombinators-paul-graham&quot;&gt;Lovers include Tim O’Reilly and YCombinator’s Paul Graham&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-cards=&quot;hidden&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;30 years on,Vi/Vim is still one of my all-time favorite computer power tools &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/Thz0ChX6eo&quot;&gt;http://t.co/Thz0ChX6eo&lt;/a&gt; Old dog, can stilllearn new tricks&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Tim O&amp;#39;Reilly (@timoreilly) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/582914712699998210&quot;&gt;March 31,2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually VIM’s keyboard shortcuts will make the distance between your brain’sthought and your screen frictionless so you will see how verbose your monkey-mindbecomes on paper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate what I mean, I created a few recordings of my favourite VIMmuscle memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;toggle-lists-to-sentences&quot;&gt;Toggle lists to sentences&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just by selecting the text and pressing &lt;code&gt;,l&lt;/code&gt; I can convert a list of words in asentence to a bulleted list, and the other way around. I’m doing this with the &lt;em&gt;TODO&lt;/em&gt; plugin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/vim/togglelists.gif&quot; alt=&quot;toggle lists&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;jump-to-text-faster-than-your-mouse&quot;&gt;Jump to text faster than your mouse.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With one key all words become listed with a letter, then by pressing thatletter your cursor will jump to that word.I’m demonstrating it slower than I actually use it. After a while this will beway faster than leaving your keyboard to use your mouse..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/vim/easymotion.gif&quot; alt=&quot;easymotion plugin&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-can-write-your-own-shortcuts-to-quickly-open-a-reference-file&quot;&gt;You can write your own shortcuts to quickly open a reference file&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the shortcuts ever get over your head, or you have other content which ishard to memorize, you can open them by a keyboard shortcut.
